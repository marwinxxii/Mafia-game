========================
Mafia virtual game table
========================

It is a simple web page for comfortable playing role game `Mafia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29>`_.
You can take a look at it `on GitHub <http://marwinxxii.github.com/Mafia-game/>`_ and `my homepage <http://marwin22.unet.ws/other/mafia.html>`_

It has:
 - Voting
 - Warnings
 - Adding new roles
 - Timer
 - Day and night display mode
 - Saving current list of players
 - Drag and drop player cards on table

Unfortunately there is only Russian language now.
The page was tested only on last versions of browsers Mozilla and Chromium (Google Chrome), requires local storage and drag and drop APIs, no other dependencies.
